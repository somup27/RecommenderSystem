# RecommenderSystem
A repository of the sample codes for the Recommender System lecture.

All of the code snippets in this repository are from Analytics Vidhya's and Medium's
article on Recommender Engines.

These code snippets are based on the MovieLens Dataset from the GroupLens Project at the University of Minnesota

CollaborativeFiltering.py is the basic code for a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering (user-user or item-item)
The output from this program is meaningless, as it is just matrixs of numbers which don't mean anything

Turicreate.py is a recommendation engine implementing using the Turicreate library, which generates recommendations automatically
The output from this program will show the list of the most similar movies of the input, albeit in the form of movie_ids

MatrixFactorization.py is a recommendation engine implemented using the matrix factorization technique.
The program displays each iteration, and the error of the matrix approximation at that iteration.
